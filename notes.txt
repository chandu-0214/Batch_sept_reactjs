1. useState Hook
Components often need to change whatâ€™s on the screen as a result of an interaction by user.
You can add state to a component with a useState Hook. Hooks are special functions that let your components use React features (state is one of those features). The useState Hook lets you declare a state variable. It takes the initial state and returns a pair of values: the current state, and a state setter function that lets you update it.

The useState Hook provides those two things:
A state variable to retain the data between renders.
A state setter function to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again. Hooksâ€”functions starting with useâ€”can only be called at the top level of your components. 
There are 3 rules for hooks:
Hooks can only be called inside React function components.
Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
Hooks cannot be conditional.
